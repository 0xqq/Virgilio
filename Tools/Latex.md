# LaTeX
LaTeX is a markup language (or, as said in the [official website](https://www.latex-project.org/about/), "a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting") used to create wonderful papers and presentations. Almost all papers you will read during your career are written using LaTeX. So, let's see how it works!

## Installation
There are several LaTeX distributios, you can see a complete list [here](http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free).

Under Unix systems, you can install [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). In particular, under Ubuntu you can type in the terminal `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`. 
Under Windows systems, you can install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) or also [TexLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/).
Under MacOs, [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/).

After the installation, you need an editor to write your LaTeX document. You can use whatever editor you want (notepad, vim, nano, gedit and so on) but I recommend you to choose [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) which is free and cross platform. It is also worth saying that Visual Studio Code with some dedicated extensions (such as [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)) is pretty good to use.

## Writing a document
There are tons of on-line guides about LaTeX. Among them:
- A comprehensive guide can be found [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).
- Another cool guide [here](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/).
- [This one](http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/skills/documents/3722/3722-2014.pdf) is perfect for beginners.
- Also [here](http://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/new-latex.pdf) another guide.

It's also possible to write your LaTeX document on-line and share it with your collaborators using [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

There are already lots of templates made. You can find some of them [here](https://www.latextemplates.com/).

To draw awesome graphs and charts, you can use the package [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ).

Also a good site to keep in mind when facing a problem with LaTeX is [StackOverflow](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) with the LaTeX dedicated section.
