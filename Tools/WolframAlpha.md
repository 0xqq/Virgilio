# WolframAlpha
[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) (WA) is a computational knowledge engine, which is a very fancy way of saying that WolframAlpha is a platform that can answer your questions. WolframAlpha is most notable for its capabilities regarding mathematics and it can be a very powerful tool to help you with your computations.

## Accessing WolframAlpha
WolframAlpha's knowledge engine can be accessed online through [wolframalpha.com](https://www.wolframalpha.com) but if you have access to a license, perhaps through your university/research center/company, you might want to install [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), _"a modern technical computing system spanning most areas of technical computing â€” including neural networks, machine learning, image processing, geometry, data science, visualizations, and others"_.

## WolframAlpha's mathematical capabilities
This little guide will focus on teaching some of the WA's mathematical capabilities. Please bear in mind that there is much more that it can do! This is what we will be covering:

  - [Basic calculations](#basiccalculations)
  - [Plotting functions](#plotting-functions)
  - Solving polynomial equations
  - Finding derivatives
  - Computing integrals
  - Finding limits
  
Some things to bear in mind: whenever you input something into WA, you get the link of your query, so that you can actually share what you asked and the answer given pretty easily. For example, following [this link](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+the+US+president) you can see what WA told me when I asked him who the US president is. Another important thing to notice is that you don't have to follow a strict syntax when asking things to WA, even though the more you can facilitate WA's life, the better.

Also note that the language WA developed, Mathematica, uses `[]` for function calls, instead of `()`, and all function names are capitalized, so `Sqrt[n]` would give you the usual square root function, that in many languages would probably be used as `sqrt(n)`.

WolframAlpha can, of course, be used as a pretty advanced calculator. Typing in `2^100` will give you the well-known answer of `1267650600228229401496703205376`. Some useful operators to know include:
  - The usual addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*` and division `/`
  - The power operator `^`, used as `x^y`, which can also be used as `Power[x, y]`
  - To find the remainder of a division, either type in `x mod m` or use `Mod[x, y]`
  - The square root is `Sqrt[x]`, and the `n`-th root of `x` is given by `Root[x, n]`, so the [cubic root of 8](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Root%5B8,+3%5D) would be found by typing in `Root[8, 3]`
