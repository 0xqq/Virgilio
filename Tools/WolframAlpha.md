# WolframAlpha
[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) (WA) is a computational knowledge engine, which is a very fancy way of saying that WolframAlpha is a platform that can answer your questions. WolframAlpha is most notable for its capabilities regarding mathematics and it can be a very powerful tool to help you with your computations.

## Accessing WolframAlpha
WolframAlpha's knowledge engine can be accessed online through [wolframalpha.com](https://www.wolframalpha.com) but if you have access to a license, perhaps through your university/research center/company, you might want to install [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), _"a modern technical computing system spanning most areas of technical computing â€” including neural networks, machine learning, image processing, geometry, data science, visualizations, and others"_.

## WolframAlpha's mathematical capabilities
This little guide will focus on teaching some of the WA's mathematical capabilities. Please bear in mind that there is much more that it can do! This is what we will be covering:

  - [Basic calculations](#basic-calculations)
  - [Plotting functions](#plotting-functions)
  - [Solving equations](#solving-equations)
  - [Matrix algebra](#matrix-algebra)
  - [Computing series and summations](#computing-series-and-summations)
  - [Finding derivatives](#finding-derivatives)
  - [Computing integrals](#computing-integrals)
  - [Finding limits](#finding-limits)
  - [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)
  
Whenever you input something into WA, you get the link of your query, so that you can actually share what you asked and the answer given pretty easily. For example, following [this link](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+the+US+president) you can see what WA told me when I asked him who the US president is. Through this guide, blue letters with a gray background give a link to a WA query. So if you click this -> [`What is the 345th decimal place of pi`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=What+is+the+345th+decimal+place+of+pi) you will see what WA answered me when I asked for the 345th decimal place of pi (it's 5, by the way).

Another important thing to notice is that you don't have to follow a strict syntax when asking things to WA, even though the more you can facilitate WA's life, the better.

Also note that Mathematica - the language developed by the creators of WA -, uses `[]` for function calls, instead of `()`, and all function names are capitalized, so `Sqrt[n]` would give you the usual square root function, that in many languages would probably be used as `sqrt(n)`. This is relevant because WA supports a subset of Mathematica's functions.
  
### Basic calculations
WolframAlpha can, of course, be used as a pretty advanced calculator. Typing in `2^100` will give you the well-known answer of `1267650600228229401496703205376`. Some useful operators to know include:
  - The usual addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*` and division `/`
  - The power operator `^`, used as `x^y`, which can also be used as `Power[x, y]`
  - To find the remainder of a division, either type in `x mod m` or use `Mod[x, y]`
  - The square root is `Sqrt[x]`, and the `n`-th root of `x` is given by `Root[x, n]`, so the [cubic root of 8](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Root%5B8,+3%5D) would be found by typing in `Root[8, 3]`
  - The factorial operator can be written as `n!` or as `Factorial[n]`
  - The logarithm and the exponential function are respectively written as `Log[x]` and `Exp[x]`

### Plotting functions
There are several different types of plots you can ask WA to do, but perhaps the most basic one would be to plot a simple function from the reals to the reals, like [plotting x^2](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+x%5E2), which can be done by typing in `plot x^2` or `plot Power[x, 2]`.\
When plotting functions, we don't always want the range that WA suggests, so [`plot x^2 from -5 to 1`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+x%5E2+from+-5+to+1) would change the range from the default to the interval from -5 to 1.

For simpler plots, writing in plain English what we want works just fine, but for more complex or intricated plots, we will be better of using the Mathematica syntax. So a regular plot like `plot x^2 from -5 to 1` becomes `Plot[x^2, {x, -5, 1}]`, where the function `Plot[]` is used to say we want a plot, the first argument `x^2` is the function we want to plot and the second argument `{x, -5, 1}` is a list (lists in Mathematica are denoted with `{}`) with the variable, the left limit and the right limit. So [`Plot[x^2, {x, -5, 1}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot%5Bx%5E2,+%7Bx,-5,1%7D%5D) produces the same plot as before.

To plot more than one function, we can give a list of functions as first argument, instead of just a function. For example, [`Plot[ {x^2, x^3, x^4}, {x, 1, 5} ]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot%5B%7Bx%5E2,+x%5E3,+x%5E4%7D,+%7Bx,+1,+5%7D%5D) will plot three different polynomials, from 1 to 5.

To plot functions of two variables, we can use the function `Plot3D`, so if we type in [`Plot3D[x^2 + y^2 + x*y, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 0}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot3D%5Bx%5E2+%2B+y%5E2+%2B+x*y,+%7Bx,+-2,+2%7D,+%7By,+-2,+0%7D%5D) we will be plotting the function `x^2 + y^2 + xy` when `x` varies between -2 and 2 and when `y` varies between -2 and 0.

### Solving equations
Solving equations can be done very easily. In fact, just typing in [`solve x^2 + x - 1 = 0 for x`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+x%5E2+%2B+x+-+1+%3D+0+for+x) gives you what you would expect. Using Mathematica notation, you would type [`Solve[x^2 + x - 1 == 0, x]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve%5Bx%5E2+%2B+x+-+1+%3D%3D+0,+x%5D).

A great thing of WA and of Mathematica as well is their ability to do symbolic calculations, which also means your equations can have parameters or other unknowns, and WA will try to give you the answer in terms of those parameters. For example, we can ask WA for the general formula to solve a polynomial equation of degree 4 with [`Solve[x^4 + b*x^3 + c*x^2 + d*x + e == 0, x]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve%5Bx%5E4+%2B+b+x%5E3+%2B+c+x%5E2+%2B+d+x+%2B+e+%3D%3D+0,+x%5D) which returns the nasty formulas.

The equations you want to solve do not need to be polynomial ones! For example, [`Solve[Log[x] + Exp[x] == 1, x]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve%5B+Log%5Bx%5D+%2B+Exp%5Bx%5D+%3D%3D+1,+x%5D) gives the value of the number `x` that solves the equation `Log[x] + Exp[x] == 1`.

Systems of equations can also be solved. Just like you would give a list of functions to the `Plot[]`, now we give a list of equations to the `Solve[]`. For example, we want to solve the two equations `Log[x] + y == 1` and `Log[x] + Log[y] == 2`, which we do by typing in [`Solve[ {Log[x] + y == 1, Log[y] + Log[x] == 2}, {x,y} ]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve%5B+%7BLog%5Bx%5D+%2B+y+%3D%3D+1,+Log%5By%5D+%2B+Log%5Bx%5D+%3D%3D+2%7D,+%7Bx,y%7D+%5D). Two **important** things to notice here! First, the result that WA gives includes a function `W` that most people won't know; WA helps people by writing slightly to the right what each component of the solution is, so WA actually says here that _"W(z) is the product log function"_, which we can then google for. Second, notice how the second argument of `Solve[]` was `{x,y}` and **not** `x`! We need to tell WA all the variables we have; if we only write `x`, then WA is trying to solve a different problem: [`Solve[ {Log[x] + y == 1, Log[y] + Log[x] == 2}, x ]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve%5B+%7BLog%5Bx%5D+%2B+y+%3D%3D+1,+Log%5By%5D+%2B+Log%5Bx%5D+%3D%3D+2%7D,+x+%5D)

### Matrix algebra
Matrices are used a lot, and sometimes we just need some place to go to check a determinant, the eigenvalues or the eigenvectors of a matrix, or maybe even invert it. You may need that, and when you do, WA has got your back.

In WA, matrices are lists of lists. The outer lists collects all the rows, and the inner lists have the elements of each row, so the identity matrix of dimension 2 would be represented as [`{ {1, 0}, {0, 1} }`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%7B%7B1,+0%7D,+%7B0,+1%7D%7D) (by just inputing the matrix WA will automatically give you plenty of information about the matrix).

To find the determinant or the trace of a matrix, you would respectively use the functions `Det[]` and `Trace[]`, so for example [`Det[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Det%5B%7B%7Ba,+b%7D,+%7Bc,+d%7D%7D%5D) gives the determinant of a general 2 by 2 matrix, and [`Trace[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Trace%5B%7B%7Ba,+b%7D,+%7Bc,+d%7D%7D%5D) gives its trace.

To find the inverse, you use [`Inverse[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Inverse%5B%7B%7Ba,+b%7D,+%7Bc,+d%7D%7D%5D).

To ask for the eigenvalues (resp. the eigenvectors) you would type in [`Eigenvalues[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Eigenvalues%5B%7B%7Ba,+b%7D,+%7Bc,+d%7D%7D%5D) (resp. [`Eigenvectors[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Eigenvectors%5B%7B%7Ba,+b%7D,+%7Bc,+d%7D%7D%5D)), even though asking for one usually also gives the other.

Of course that all of this can be done with bigger matrices, and matrices with actual numbers, not just parameters! For example, we can compute the eigenvalues of some 5 by 5 matrix, say [`Eigenvalues[{{1,2,3,4,5},{6,7,8,9,10},{11,12,13,14,15},{16,17,18,19,20},{21,22,23,24,25}}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Eigenvalues%5B%7B%7B1,2,3,4,5%7D,%7B6,7,8,9,10%7D,%7B11,12,13,14,15%7D,%7B16,17,18,19,20%7D,%7B21,22,23,24,25%7D%7D%5D) are `0, 0, 0, -3.642, 68.64`.

Probably more relevant for university courses, but WA also diagonalizes matrices/finds their Jordan canonical form. For that, use [`JordanDecomposition[{{1, 2}, {0, 3}}]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=JordanDecomposition%5B%7B%7B1,+2%7D,+%7B0,+3%7D%7D%5D) which also gives the similarity matrix and the matrix in diagonal/Jordan canonical form.

### Miscellaneous
To find if a number is prime, you can use the function `PrimeQ[]`, for example type [`PrimeQ[4234523457]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=PrimeQ%5B4234523457%5D) to conclude that 4234523457 is not a prime number because `4234523457 = 3Ã—53Ã—97Ã—463Ã—593`.

Similarly, use the function `Prime[]` to find out the `n`-th prime. For example, type [`Prime[4234523457]`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Prime%5B4234523457%5D) to find out that the 4234523457th prime is `102951556637`.
